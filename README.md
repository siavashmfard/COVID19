# COVID19

World Health Organization declared COVID19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and since the outbreak, more than 13 million people have been infected around the world. There have been many studies on the effect of different indices and factors on the COVID19 numbers in different countries. But to the best of authorâ€™s knowledge, there has not been any study on the response of countries based on their GDP, hospital beds, age over 65, diabetes prevalence, etc.

In addition, in another part of this report, the effect of women leadership representation on COVID response was studied based on ministerial percentage, women political score and whether the current leader is female or not. Unfortunately, only a mere 10 percent of total world leaders are women which makes it difficult for any statistical analysis.
